Dear HWR people,

writing: register disappiontment about the current categorisation(?) of competitors i.e. intemediate club, senior, etc

why: too many entries into club by people of national standard, which should be an intemediate category (as the name suggests)

# means that people in club level don't have a chance to compete to win as we have day jobs etc so can't devote the day to training 2+ times per day.

highlight:
	number in internationals in top boats
	difference between winning boat time and 'normal' time, and difference between senior winning time and club winning time.

overall: 
	keep category competitve between crews of a similar standard, seems unfair to pay to race and get only one race, or not to qualify. Racing should be fun, and between crews who can compete with one another.
